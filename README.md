- 🏜️ I have worked on many projects, but some of them are private or abandoned...
- 🕹️ However, I'm currently working on two new projects with Python: a [puzzle game](https://github.com/Nash115/The_overflowing_void) and a [survival game](https://github.com/Nash115/Surviving_the_fire) (built with the library [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel))!
